                - Set up roleplay again before climactic moment 

        Game Design:

            Nell:
                - Liked moves about suppressing and controlling powers
                - Intersection between moves and powers 
                    - How do you use powers for situational advantage
                    - What does it look like when some powers happen? Ie fire hands apply fire damage. Have players define the mechanical effects of using powers. 
                - Progression system    
                    - Love an idiots guide to budding
                    - Balance the trait system so that it doesnt push you away from 0
                    - I like the thinking about character's arc and getting other players to buy into them 
                    - What are character's/player's dramatic buttons, this system finds them well 
                    - Lock down system, more declaring of destination. Too much ambiguity around how many clocks i should have and what I should be working towards

                - gameplay stances
                    - pawn
                    - actor
                    - director
                    - Die rolls are great because they reduce the cognitive load of coming up with both the problems and the solutions

                - Distance, stress, connection
                - Character relationship leveling stats

            John:
                - Combat
                    - Likes action
                    - Missing feeling of orientation in space and time 
                        - Dont need initiative
                        - Change in technique to run combat, John felt lost at times where he felt poised to act. This feels solvable with more well defined moveset. 
                        - Nell: GM combat like a MF dolphin
                - Like trait system, wonder if there's a better way to track buildup


            Franklet:
                - Explicit mechanics are actually not so desirable for me 
                - Categories of feeling towards someone, gain and lose stats regarding these traits (trust, fear, respect)
