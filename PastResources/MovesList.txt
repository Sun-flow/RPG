    //For a time when a player wishes to maintain control over something, such as their willpower, a use of their powers, or an object
    //On 10+, choose 3. On 7-9, choose 2.
        - Maintain control of the target (powers, item, person's thoughts)

}

Act(){
    //For a time when a player wishes to complete an action that does not fall under the purview of other Moves
    On 10+, character completes specified action with no complication.
    On 7-9, character completes specified action, but the GM may impose a cost, complication, or choice.
}

Discern(){
    //For a time when a player wishes for their character to piece together information in order to gain understanding, or when they wish to gain clarity on something that is unclear (even when viewing physically).
    //This move is always rolled with the insight trait.
    On 10+, the player may decide how well their character gains understanding from the information provided to them, likely a very favourable outcome
    On 7-9, the GM will tell the player how well their character gains undrstanding from the information provided to them, likely a moderately favourable outcome
}

Contest(){ //list of contests
    //For a situation when two or more entities are vying for control of a target or are matching will against one another
    
    Statement of Intent: Each entity must state their desired outcome, or what they are attempting to come out in control of
   
    //Maybe make stakes GM only
    Stakes: Each entity must decide what they are risking by engaging in this contest, or what they stand to lose in the event of a defeat
        Low Stakes: What is the minimum an entity might lose, in the event that they lose the contest
        High Stakes: What is the maximum an entity might lose, in the event that they lose the contest

    For Player vs. Player:
        Each player rolls individually with their desired attribute

    For Player vs. Non-player:
        The player will determine Statement of Intent and Stakes with the GM
        Roll against the GM

    Outcome:
        The player who rolls higher will "win" the contest. Subtract the loser's roll from the winners roll, then determine outcome.
        On 1-2, Winner gains control of contested objective, loser and winner both lose at least their Low Stakes
        On 3, Winner gains control of contested objective, loser loses at least Low Stakes. If loser loses High Stakes, winner must lose their Low Stakes
